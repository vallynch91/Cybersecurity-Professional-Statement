Step 2

Collaborative- Strong team player.
Integrity- Value honesty, ethics, transperacy & to do what's best for any company I have the privilege to work for.
Innovation- Always working to do better, learn new skills & calculated risks. 

Step 3

a)
The field of cybersecurity that most interests me is threat response and forensics. As an analytic person, I like to search and find where the problem begins, how to act to catch the threat, and take corrective actions to prevent future occurrences.
b)
The ideal audience would be cybersecurity recruiters, big organizations, too, and online professional profiles. I have updated my LinkedIn profile recently, and it's a good way to share how my career grows. I'm open to all the opportunities that come.
c)
I am a good candidate for organizations because I am a really compromised, passionate, and responsible person. I am constantly taking capacitation to continue learning. I always believed that the way to make things is with a conscious mind and focused effort on the objective, with a good work team, and strong and respectful communication, always making the work in the mark of the law and ethical things. I am a good leader and that involves guiding the team and sharing knowledge and values. The values make the person.
